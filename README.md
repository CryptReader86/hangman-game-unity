# hangman-game-unity
[![Made with Unity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Unity-57b9d3.svg?style=flat&logo=unity)](https://unity3d.com)

This is a simple hangman game made with Unity. This was made to try to understand the concept of the simplified Clean Architecture, as you can see in the following article:

[Simplified Clean Architecture Design Pattern for Unity](https://genki-sano.medium.com/simplified-clean-architecture-design-pattern-for-unity-967931583c47)

## Plugins
The following plugins were used in the development of this simple game:
* [NSubstitute](https://nsubstitute.github.io/) for mocking the tests
* [Zenject](https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject) for dependency injection
* [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx) for reversing the direction of dependency
